Sequelize Burger


The previous work - Burgers - handlebars was used to render HTML onto the page, and the MVC model for folder structure. Sequelized is used instead of an ORM to store and update the burger data for the client.

I created this with MySQL, MySQL2, Node, Express, Handlebars. I followed the MVC design pattern; use Node and MySQL and Sequelize and Handlebars to generate the HTML.

Try Burgers from Different States! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the page -- waiting to be devoured. Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour button. When the user clicks it, the burger has been eaten. This will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
